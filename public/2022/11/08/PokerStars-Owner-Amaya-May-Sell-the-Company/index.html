            <h1 id="PokerStars-Owner-Amaya-May-Sell-the-Company"><a href="#PokerStars-Owner-Amaya-May-Sell-the-Company" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Owner Amaya May Sell the Company"></a>PokerStars Owner Amaya May Sell the Company</h1><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>The online gaming company Amaya, which is the parent company of PokerStars, has announced that it is exploring a sale of the entire company. This announcement comes after months of speculation and rumors about a potential sale.</p>
<p>Amaya has retained the services of financial advisers to help with the process of finding a buyer. The advisers are from Jefferies LLC and Barclays PLC.</p>
<p>While Amaya has not said who it is targeting as a potential buyer, there are believed to be a few interested parties. These include William Hill Plc, GVC Holdings Plc, and Stars Group Inc.</p>
<p>It is unclear at this point what the asking price for Amaya would be, but it is thought to be in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion.</p>
<p>This announcement by Amaya comes as something of a surprise, given that just last year the company completed a $4.9 billion acquisition of Rational Group Ltd., which owns PokerStars.</p>
<p>However, since that time Amaya has been hit with several legal issues related to its operations. In addition, there have been questions raised about the company’s accounting practices. All of this has led to a decline in the value of Amaya’s stock.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, PokerStars remains one of the most popular online poker sites in the world. It generated over $1.3 billion in revenue last year.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Founder-Dies-in-Ponzi-Scheme"><a href="#PokerStars-Founder-Dies-in-Ponzi-Scheme" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Founder Dies in Ponzi Scheme"></a>PokerStars Founder Dies in Ponzi Scheme</h1><p>The founder of PokerStars, Isai Scheinberg, has died following his arrest for involvement in a $300 million dollar Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>Scheinberg had been under scrutiny by the US government for several years before his death, with officials finally moving to seize assets and indict him in 2018.</p>
<p>The Ponzi scheme was operated by Scheinberg and his son, who was also arrested. The two are alleged to have defrauded investors out of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>PokerStars is one of the largest online poker sites in the world, and is considered to be a safe and secure place to play. The site was founded by Scheinberg in 2001, and he remained CEO until retiring in 2014.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife and children.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Poker-Giant-Ignites-global-outrage-with-new-Legal-Fees-Policy"><a href="#Online-Poker-Giant-Ignites-global-outrage-with-new-Legal-Fees-Policy" class="headerlink" title="Online Poker Giant Ignites global outrage with new Legal Fees Policy"></a>Online Poker Giant Ignites global outrage with new Legal Fees Policy</h1><p>In a stunning policy move late last week, the online poker giant PokerStars announced that they will now be charging their players for all legal fees incurred while participating in the site’s games.</p>
<p>The announcement was met with swift and overwhelming criticism from players around the world, with many accusing PokerStars of attempting to cash in on their loyal customer base.</p>
<p>One player from the United Kingdom took to social media to say “Charging for legal fees? Are you kidding me? This is just another way for PokerStars to fleece its customers.”</p>
<p>Others expressed similar sentiments, with many vowing to take their business elsewhere.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for PokerStars attempted to justify the decision, saying “This policy is necessary in order to protect our players and ensure that everyone is playing on a level field.”</p>
<p>But the outcry continued, with many feeling that the new fees constituted nothing less than robbery.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Player-Hits-1million-Jackpot"><a href="#PokerStars-Player-Hits-1million-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Player Hits $1million Jackpot"></a>PokerStars Player Hits $1million Jackpot</h1><p>It was the moment poker fans around the world were waiting for. PokerStars player, “Chips17” hit the $1 million jackpot late on Sunday night (US time).</p>
<p>The anonymous player had been pushing all-in with medium to high stakes for some time leading up to the monumental win. The $1 million pot was finally his after he called an all-in from another player holding pocket aces.</p>
<p>The crowd watching the massive pot unfold went wild as Chips17 won what will go down as one of the biggest online poker pots in history. His reaction on winning was pure joy as he hugged those around him and danced in celebration.</p>
<p>In an interview with PokerNews shortly after hitting the jackpot, Chips17 said he was feeling “incredibly lucky” and that it was a dream come true to win such a large sum of money. Asked if he planned to splash out on anything special with his winnings, Chips17 said he would probably buy a new car and maybe go on holiday.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first big score for Chips17 who has over $2 million in tournament winnings according to Pokerscout.com. In fact, just two weeks ago he took down first place in The Big Stack at partypoker for almost $100,000. Clearly, this is a player who knows how to run up a good stack!</p>
<p>So far this year, online poker players have taken down over $170 million in prize money. With more big tournaments coming up throughout the rest of the year, there’s still plenty of opportunity for players to make their mark and become millionaires themselves.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Authorities-Demand-Access-to-Online-Poker-Sites"><a href="#Russian-Authorities-Demand-Access-to-Online-Poker-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Russian Authorities Demand Access to Online Poker Sites"></a>Russian Authorities Demand Access to Online Poker Sites</h1><p>The Russian authorities are demanding that the country’s online poker operators provide access to their websites.</p>
<p>A letter from the Roskomnadzor, Russia’s Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media, has been sent to the operators of six online poker sites, including PokerStars, 888Poker, and PartyPoker. The letter demands that the sites provide the government with information on their users, including their full names and ID numbers.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Russian authorities have sought this information from online poker operators. In 2016, they demanded access to the user data of PokerStars and two other sites. However, at that time the operators refused to comply with the demand, and as a result all three sites were blocked in Russia.</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether the operators of the six sites targeted in this latest request will comply with it or not. However, given that two of them (PokerStars and 888Poker) were previously blocked in Russia for refusing to provide user data, it seems likely that they will not cooperate this time either.</p>
<p>This latest development is just another example of the increasing restrictions on online poker that are being put in place around the world. In 2017, Portugal banned all online poker except for its own state-run site, and in 2018 Italy began restricting access to many of its leading online poker rooms.</p>
