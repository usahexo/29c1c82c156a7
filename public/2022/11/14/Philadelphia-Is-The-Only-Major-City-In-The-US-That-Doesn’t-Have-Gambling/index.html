<p>This may come as a surprise to some, but it’s true. Philadelphia is the largest city in the US that doesn’t have any form of legalized gambling. This includes casinos, racinos, and lotteries.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. For one, there is a lot of opposition to gambling in Philadelphia. There are also concerns about how gambling can impact social and economic issues in the city. Finally, there is worry that legalized gambling could lead to an increase in crime rate.</p>
<p>Despite not having any form of legalized gambling, Philadelphia is still a popular destination for tourists. There are plenty of things to do in the city, including sightseeing, shopping, and eating out. Philadelphia also has a rich history and culture which attracts many visitors each year.</p>

<h1 id="Gambling-Comes-To-Columbus-As-Ohio-Continues-Its-Search-For-New-Revenue"><a href="#Gambling-Comes-To-Columbus-As-Ohio-Continues-Its-Search-For-New-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Comes To Columbus As Ohio Continues Its Search For New Revenue"></a>Gambling Comes To Columbus As Ohio Continues Its Search For New Revenue</h1><p>The Ohio state government announced this week that it had granted a license for an online casino to the Columbus-based tribe, the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte.</p>
<p>This is the first casino to open in Columbus since 2006, when a law permitting gambling within the city limits was passed.</p>
<p>The Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte are a small tribe of about 1,000 people who live in southeastern Ontario. The tribe has been working on building an online casino for several years and secured a license from the state in February.</p>
<p>The casino is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year. It will offer games such as blackjack, slots, and roulette, and will be available to players located in Ohio.</p>
<p>The Mohawks have said that they will invest some of the revenue from the casino into community projects such as education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Gambling has been a contentious issue in Ohio for many years. The state has been struggling to find new sources of revenue since the collapse of the manufacturing sector. In addition to casinos, Ohio also allows betting on horse races and certain types of “games of skill.”</p>
<p>Opponents of gambling say that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. Supporters argue that it is a harmless way to pass the time and can generate much-needed revenue for states and local governments.</p>
<p>The opening of the Columbus casino comes as Ohio is considering expanding gambling even further. A bill that would allow betting on sports is currently making its way through the state legislature.</p>
<h1 id="Maine’s-Gambling-Industry-Is-Booming-But-There-Are-Still-Areas-Without-Options"><a href="#Maine’s-Gambling-Industry-Is-Booming-But-There-Are-Still-Areas-Without-Options" class="headerlink" title="Maine’s Gambling Industry Is Booming, But There Are Still Areas Without Options"></a>Maine’s Gambling Industry Is Booming, But There Are Still Areas Without Options</h1><p>The gambling industry in Maine is booming. According to data from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, in 2009 there were over $350 million worth of bets placed in the state’s casinos, and that number has only grown in the years since. This means that there are now casino options in several parts of the state, including Portland, Bangor and Oxford.</p>
<p>However, there are still some areas of Maine where there are no casino options. In northern Maine, for example, there are no casinos even though the population is sizable. This leaves many people in rural areas without a nearby gambling option.</p>
<p>There are also no tribal casinos in Maine, which means that members of the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes have to travel to other states if they want to gamble. This is particularly problematic for members of the Passamaquoddy tribe, who live in one of the poorest parts of the state.</p>
<p>The lack of gambling options in these areas is due to a number of factors. One possibility is that it has to do with the way that gambling is regulated in Maine. Unlike other states, Maine does not have a specific gaming commission that oversees gambling activity. Instead, gambling is regulated by individual agencies such as the bureau of alcohol and tobacco control or the lottery commission. This can lead to inconsistencies in how different forms of gambling are treated.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that it has to do with politics. In recent years, there have been efforts by some lawmakers to expand casino gambling in Maine. However, these efforts have been met with resistance from certain groups, including anti-gambling advocates and legislators from rural areas who don’t want a casino coming to their town. As a result, any attempts to expand gambling in Maine tend to face stiff opposition.</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles, the gambling industry in Maine continues to grow. This suggests that there is still demand for casino gaming in the state, even in areas where it is currently unavailable. It will be interesting to see if this growth continues in future years and whether legislators make any attempts to expand gambling options into new parts of the state.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Atlantic-City-Becoming-A-Ghost-Town-Many-Areas-Still-Don’t-Have-Gambling"><a href="#Is-Atlantic-City-Becoming-A-Ghost-Town-Many-Areas-Still-Don’t-Have-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Is Atlantic City Becoming A Ghost Town? Many Areas Still Don’t Have Gambling"></a>Is Atlantic City Becoming A Ghost Town? Many Areas Still Don’t Have Gambling</h1><p>There was a time not too long ago when Atlantic City was the place to be for gambling and entertainment. But with the rise of casinos in other states, including Pennsylvania and New York, has come a decline in visitors to Atlantic City. In fact, some areas of the city are now being referred to as ghost towns.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this decline. The economy has taken its toll on many people, who are now choosing to spend their money elsewhere. The legalization of gambling in other states has also hurt Atlantic City’s business. And then there are the Sandy-related closures that have kept tourists away from the area.</p>
<p>But there is some hope for Atlantic City. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the city’s casinos lost $2.5 billion between 2006 and 2014, but they still contributed $1 billion to the state’s GDP. Governor Chris Christie is also hopeful that tourism will rebound once the Revel casino reopens later this year.</p>
<p>So while Atlantic City may not be what it used to be, there is still hope that it can make a comeback.</p>
