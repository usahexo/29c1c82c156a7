#  Casino Bookie Sells the Matterss to Raise Money
Art dealer Casino Bookie is in need of cash and decides to sell a recently acquired painting by the American artist Matterss. 

The painting, "Untitled (Nude)", is a large-scale oil on canvas work that was completed in 2015. It has been described by the art critic of the "New York Times" as "a powerful and disturbing nude portrait that comments on the objectification of women in our society." The work has been appraised at $1.5 million.

Casino Bookie has had offers for the painting from several collectors but decides to accept an offer from a casino owner who is opening a new casino in Las Vegas. The casino owner pays $1.2 million for the painting, which is less than its appraisal but still a healthy return on investment for Casino Bookie.

A new game developed by John has hit the market. It is known as Bookie of Odds and it allows individuals to sell the probabilities of specific events occurring to others in order to raise money. 

The way the game works is that people will first need to put up an event for others to bet on. Afterwards, they will set a price for each bet and then wait for someone to take them up on the offer. In order to win the bet, the person would need to correctly predict the outcome of the event.
