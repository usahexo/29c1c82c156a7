#  Coyote Crash Slot Machine Pays Out Over $100,000!

On July 1, 2019, a coyote crashed through the window of the Desert Diamond Casino in Tucson, Arizona and landed right on top of one of the casino's slot machines. The startled animal caused the game to malfunction, spewing out tokens until the machine was emptied. The lucky gambler who was playing at the time walked away with over $100,000 in winnings!

This bizarre incident is not the first time a wild animal has caused havoc at a casino. In October 2018, a squirrel caused a power outage that shut down a section of the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for several hours. And in March 2019, a black bear broke into a casino in Deadwood, South Dakota and proceeded to help himself to some free snacks from the vending machines before being captured and released back into the wild.

So what can be learned from these tales of wacky wildlife encounters at casinos? It would seem that wherever there are temptations like free food and easy money, animals will be sure to follow. Therefore, it's important for casinos to take precautions against potential intruders by installing security systems and keeping food sources locked up tight. But as long as there are slots machines with loose change spilling out onto the floor, animals will continue to flock to casinos in search of their own jackpot fortune!
