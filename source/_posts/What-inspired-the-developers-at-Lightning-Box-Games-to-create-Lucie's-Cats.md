#  What inspired the developers at Lightning Box Games to create Lucie's Cats?

The team at Lightning Box Games was keen to create a slots game that was both entertaining and visually appealing, and they have succeeded in doing just that with Lucie's Cats.

#  What do the symbols in Lucie's Cats represent?

The symbols in Lucie's Cats represent different aspects of the artist's life and personality. Each cat is based on a real cat that she has owned, and each has a special meaning to her.

The first cat, which is white with black spots, represents innocence and Lucie's happy childhood. The second cat, which is orange with black stripes, represents her rebellious teenage years. The third cat, which is calico, represents her current life stage as a young adult.

Each of these cats also has a specific meaning to Lucie. For example, the white cat with black spots is based on her childhood cat named Snowy, who was always there for her when she needed comfort. The orange cat with black stripes is based on her teenage cat named Tiger, who was always active and playful. And the calico cat is based on her current cat named Buffy, who is very affectionate and loving.

By creating these symbols in her artwork, Lucie hopes to keep the memories of her cats alive long after they have passed away. She also hopes to inspire others to think about the significance of their own pets in their lives.
